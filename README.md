Hi, if you're seeing this repository then you're most probably a friend of mine who's having trouble with the Programming Lab Assignments. No worries - I've gathered the solutions of most of the questions in the assignments here.   
>Please use these solutions responsibly; they're here to aid your learning and help you grow.
## üìÅ Structure
1. Each assignment will have a dedicated repository which you should be able to find on my profile.
2. I will only be providing the solutions of the tricky and somewhat difficult questions. Solutions of the easier problems are available on the internet and are easily findable.
3. I will use comments to explain the logic wherever necessary but you will only be able to understand the solutions if you spend time with the problem and the solution yourself.
4. If you still have trouble understanding then just drop me a mail and I will try my level best to make you understand.
## Naming Convention
All files in each repository will be named as - 
> A1Q01

Here the first number i.e. A***1***Q01 will denote the assignment number and the second number i.e. A1Q***01*** will denote the question number in that assignment.
